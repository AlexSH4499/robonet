# Robonet
<p>This is a small project for the 2019 Summer Internship at V-Team.
  The aim of this project is to provide a use case for future telecommunications technologies and their impact on unmmanned or remotely manned systems.
</p>
<p>Important:
  This project runs on two versions of Python due to incompatibility with Leap Motion SDK and Python 3.0.
  I tried to compile the SDK from source with no fruits on Windows and ran into problems when trying on Ubuntu Linux Subsystem thanks to to lack of daemon functionality. My apologies for the shortcomings on this part of the project but I really tried my best given my time constraints.</p>
  
## Libraries(or dependencies)
- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- requests (Python 3 and 3.7)
- coreapi
- Leap Motion SDK
- Niryo One Python API(python 2.7)
